        <h2>Basic Page Title</h2>
        <p>When a commercial truck has an accident, the trucking company needs to be insured to protect themselves from four distinct types of claims.  A single accident is likely to result in damages for each of these four categories, making it monumentally important that a truck insurance company is fully covering each category of claims.</p>

        <h3>Liability Insurance</h3>
        <p>Truck liability insurance covers the damage that is done to the other party.  If a tractor trailer damages a delivery dock while dropping off a load, payment will be made to the shipment receiver for repairs.  If a truck strikes another vehicle, the insurer will pay for the repairs required by the other vehicle.  If a pedestrian or a driver in another vehicle is hurt by your truck, the insurance company will pay for the medical bill.</p>

        <h3>Cargo Insurance</h3>
        <p>If a tractor trailer carrying a load of fine china gets jostled and partially destroyed while going over a curb, itâ€™s good to have cargo insurance coverage.  Likewise, if the trailer is broken into and some of the shipment is stolen, the truck insurance agents will be writing the check, and not you.</p>
